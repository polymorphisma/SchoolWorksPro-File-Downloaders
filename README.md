# SchoolWorksPro-File-Downloaders
This Python script allows SchoolWorksPro users to download all the files in a module with just one command. The script uses the SchoolWorksPro API to authenticate the user and retrieve a list of all the files in the module. It then downloads all the files to a specified directory on the user's local machine.
